_MySQL_Covid_

Analysis about the coronavirus pandemic using data updated on 15.05.2021. Two main issue: covid's deaths and vaccination programs around the world, with a little focus on my contry, Italy.

Originally the tables used (covid_deaths and covid_vaccinations) were in csv format, and are available on website "Our world in data". 
Tool used for the analysis: MySQL Workbench.
